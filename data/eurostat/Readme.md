# NUTS 2021 Classification

The NUTS classification (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of the EU and the UK for various purposes. More information can be found on the offical EU website: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background

The NUTS data is used in this project for two purposes:
1. A convenient way to use the geometry of the country Germany to filter the Corine Land Cover 2018 data
2. Present different administrative units on a map, here: aggregate area data by NUTS zone.

The data can be downloaded from the official source here:
